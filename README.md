# Gifer
This is an android app app made solly to provide an example of my code style. This repo is mainly intended for people looking to hire me as Android Developer.

# Premise

The app has a search bar that queries [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) and shows previews of gifs. You can click on the items to watch the full video of the gif. You can also rate the items which will be stored locally.
